## NIL Card CBV (Confidence Builder Version)

## Overview
NIL Card CBV is a confidence-builder version of my NIL Card idea: a simple web app where college athletes create a clean, shareable profile (their “NIL card”) with social metrics and contact info. Athletes share a one-time (or edit-token) link with brands to make outreach easier and more professional.

**Goal (CBV):** Build a small, finished product that I can explain and rebuild confidently without relying on AI to generate the code.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database:** Supabase (Postgres)
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Language:** TypeScript

## Project Principles (CBV Rules)
- Keep scope intentionally small and shippable.
- Ship features in phases; finish each phase before starting the next.
- AI is used as a reviewer, not a code generator (see: `AI_CONTRACT.md`).
- Focus on clean UI, clean data model, and reliable CRUD flows.
